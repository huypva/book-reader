   1. You can use other [Document Loaders](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/document_loaders.html) to load your own data into the vectorstore.
1. Run the app: `make start`
   1. To enable tracing, make sure `langchain-server` is running locally and pass `tracing=True` to `get_chain` in `main.py`. You can find more documentation [here](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tracing.html).
